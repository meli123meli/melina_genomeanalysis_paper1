# melina_genomeanalysis_paper1
In this repository I keep the code and work process I follow in the course genome analysis, paper I.
The code is found under <a href ="https://github.com/meli123meli/melina_genomeanalysis_paper1/tree/main/codeclean"> Codeclean </a>. In the wiki, the page "Project plan" includes a short introduction, a time plan, software planned to be used and a draft for data organization. The page "Report" includes information about methods, results, interpretation of the performed steps, plus additionally answered questions. There can also be found a page called "Documentation", where I comment on the work in a time line like style.
